## üß± Database Schema

```sql
-- Aisle Table
CREATE TABLE aisle(
    aisle_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    aisle VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Department Table
CREATE TABLE departments(
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Product Table
CREATE TABLE product(
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    aisle_id INT REFERENCES aisle(aisle_id),
    department_id INT REFERENCES departments(department_id),
    unit_cost DECIMAL(4,2),
    unit_price DECIMAL(4,2)
);

-- Orders Table
CREATE TABLE orders(
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    product_id INT REFERENCES product(product_id),
    quantity INT,
    order_date DATE,
    order_down INT,
    order_hour_of_the_day INT,
    days_since_prior_order INT,
    order_status VARCHAR(50)
);
